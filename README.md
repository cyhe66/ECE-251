Computer Architecture

ALU Design Assignment
  Design a 4-bit ALU using a 22V10 programmable logic device. 

PIC Assignment
  Implement Counter Demo Program- Modify the Counter with two inputs- one that halts the counter and one that toggles the increment of
  the counter by one or two. Apply a delay euqal to, in milliseconds, the number in the W register when the Delay subroutine is called. 

Final- Custom Computer
  Use a PIC microcontroller and ALU to construct  a computer that implements custom instruction set and functions. 
  Write programs in Assembly, and manually translate to the processors "machine code", and then demonstrate the functionality 
  of the program.
